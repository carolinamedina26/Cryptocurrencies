The purpose of this analysis is create a report that details which cryptocurrencies are trending in the market, as well as, the creation of a classification system for this cryptocurrencies.

Since the output is unknown we decided to use unsupervised learning.First we started cleaning our data, then we preform the elbow curve method to determine the number of cluster we will use for our analysis. Then we fit our model and created ad 3d graph with the results for further analysis. Finally we used the clustering algorithm, create a data frame and graph with the findings.
